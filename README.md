# Challenge-1

## Description

The Challenge-1 project was an *On-the-job ticket* to refactor the existing code for Horiseon Marketing Agency's Webpage. I followed semantic HTML and CSS formatting to organize and clean up the code of the webpage without changing what the code does or how it looks on the webpage. Following semantic formatting I learned how to eliminate repetative code and write cleaner code. This will help me be more effective and less repetative for future projects.
